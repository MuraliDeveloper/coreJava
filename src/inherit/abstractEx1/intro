special classes in inheritance:
->abstract class
->interface

BOTH ARE PARENT CLASSES

abstract class:
-> should be used only in Inheritance.
-> always a parent class.
->we cannot create object
-> abstract class has  concrete methods  [ abstract methods and non-abstract methods ]
 -> If a class has one abstract method then class has to be abstract class...
->syntax for abstract class:

public abstract class RBI{
  
  public void display(){
   
   }
   
   public abstract void display1();
}

The only way to use abstract class is by creating child class

->Abstract class has two types of methods:
   1. Non abstract methods  (method declaration + method body)
   public void display(){
   
   }
   2. abstract methods (has only method declaration ; abstract method does not have any logic)
   public abstract void display1();
   

  
--> create a class that extends the Abstract class [ only way to use abstract class]  
-->  For a child class overriding is mandatory for the abstract methods, 

 CREATE CHILD CLASS FOR ABSTRACT CLASS
public class SBI extends RBI{
  // Overriding the display1 method is mandatory 
  
  public abstract void display1(){
  
  }
}
