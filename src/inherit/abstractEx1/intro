special classes in inheritance:
->abstract class
->interface

BOTH ARE PARENT CLASSES

abstract class:
-> should be used only in Inheritance.
-> always a parent class.
->we cannot create object
-> abstract class has  concrete methods  [ abstract methods and non-abstract methods ]
 -> If a class has one abstract method then class has to be abstract class...
->syntax for abstract class:

public abstract class RBI{
  
  
}


->Abstract class has two types of methods:
   1. Non abstract methods  (method declaration + method body)
   public void display(){
   
   }
   2. abstract methods (has only method declaration ; abstract method does not have any logic)
   public abstract void display1();
   

  
--> create a class that extends the Abstract class [ only way to use abstract class]  
-->  For a child class overriding is mandatory for the abstract methods, 

 CREATE CHILD CLASS FOR ABSTRACT CLASS
public class SBI extends RBI{
  // Overriding the display1 method is mandatory 
  
  public abstract void display1(){
  
  }
}
















Interface:
-> should be used only in inherience.
->we cannot create object

Interface = 100 % abstract class
->Interface has only abstract methods  
and only public static final variables.
-> No instance variables + constr 


->syntax for interface class:
 
	public interface RBI {
    
     public static final int count =50;
  		 public abstract void display();
  	   public abstract void show();
  
   }
   

Whats the only way to use interface?   
--> create a class that implements Interface    
-->  For a child class overriding is mandatory for the abstract methods,

 


Use Extends --> normal class+ abstarct class
Use implements --> interface  

child class for interface:
public class SBI implements RBI {
  //overriding the display() and show() are mandatory....
  
}

Interface supports multiple inhertence.
  
public interface RBI {
  		 public abstract void display();
  	   public abstract void show();
  
   }

public interface WB {
  		 public abstract void ppf();
  	   public abstract void draft();
  
   }



public class SBI implements  RBI, WB  {
  //overriding the display() and show()  ppf() and draft()  are mandatory....
  
}
