  pubic void m1(){
    
  }
  
  private void m3(){

  public static void m4(){
    
  }
}





public class Employee extends Person{

	String pan;
	String pfNo;

  public void m2(){

}


    
How many I.V are in Person : 3 
How manyI.V are in Employee : 5 
  
How many METHODS are in Person : 1 
How many METHODS are in Employee : 2
