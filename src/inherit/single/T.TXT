Inheritence:
relationship between two classes.
-> its a Is-a relation.
-> there are two types of classes.
  
  a)Parent class/Super class/Base class
  b)sub class/child class/derived class
    
    
Public properties and methods are inherited/available to child class from parent class.
private, static are not eligible for inheritence.


 Ex:
 1.Parent class : Loan
 Child classes: Vehicleloan, marriageLoan, personalLoan

 2.Parent class : Account
 Child classes: CurrentAccount , LoanAccount ,CreditCardAccount
 
 3.Parent class : Card
 Child classes: CreditCard , DebitCard , VirtalCard
 
 
   
  
advantage: 
reusability of instance varibles and methods in multiple classes

syntax:


Req:
Person has id,name, age
Employee has id, name, age, pan , pf


Without Inheritence:

public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
}



public class Employee {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  String pan;
  String pf;

  
}




With inheritance:
Person is parent
Employee is child class

How to specify  the inheritance between Person and Employee??
 public class Employee extends Person {
 }
   
public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
}
    



public class Employee extends Person {
  String pan;
  String pf;

  
}



Write Properties/Method in parent class and reuse for Parent class and child class.




public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  
  
  pubic void m1(){
    
  }
  
}


Eligible for inheritence:
1.id,name, age 
2. m1() 




public class Employee extends Person{// Here Employee is the Child claas and Person is parent class

	String pan;
	String pfNo;

  public void m2(){
    
  }
}


    
How many I.V are in Person : 3 
How many I.V are in Employee : 5 
  
How many METHODS are in Person : 1 
How many METHODS are in Employee : 2
  
  
 Case#2:

public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  
  private int count;
  
  pubic void m1(){
    
  }
  
  private void m3(){
    
  }
  
  public static void m4(){
    
  }
}


Eligible for inheritence:
1.id,name, age 
2. m1() 

  


Types of inheritence:
-----------------------
1.Single
2.Multi Level
3.Hierarchial
4.Multiple inheritence is not allowed n java
