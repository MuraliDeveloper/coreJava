Inheritence:
relationship between two classes.
-> its a Is-a relation.
-> there are two types of classes.
  
  a)Parent class/SUper class/Basse class
  b)sub class/child class/derived class
    
    
Public properties and methods are inherited/available to child class from parene class.
private, static are not eligible for inheritence.
  
  
adv: 
reusability

syntax:


Req:
Person has id,name, age
Employee has id, name, age, pan , pf


Without Inheritence:

public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
}



public class Employee {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  String pan;
  String pf;

  
}




With Inheritence:

    
public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
}
    



public class Employee extends Person {
  String pan;
  String pf;

  
}



Write Properties/Method in parent class and reuse for Parent class and child class.




public class Person {
	  String name;
	  int age;
	  int id;
  
  private int count;
  
  pubic void m1(){
    
  }
  
  private void m3(){
    
  }
  
  public static void m4(){
    
  }
}





public class Employee extends Person{// Here Employee is the Child claas and Person is parent class

	String pan;
	String pfNo;

  public void m2(){
    
  }
}


    
How many I.V are in Person : 3 
How manyI.V are in Employee : 5 
  
How many METHODS are in Person : 1 
How many METHODS are in Employee : 2
