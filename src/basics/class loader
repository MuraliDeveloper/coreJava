What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files.
 Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. Java provides three built-in classloaders:

Bootstrap ClassLoader
Extension ClassLoader
System/Application ClassLoader
