	File handling:
---------------
-> Create file/folder
-> delete file/folder
-> Write to file
-> Read from file

For working with files  use java.io package...

->There are two types of files.
1. charater stream  ex: only text files
Write : FileWriter class
Read : FileReader class


2. Byte stream   ex: text and non text files image, pdf, document, etc....
Write : FileOutputStream class
Read : FileInputStream class

 
 Exception handling is mandatory for the file operations...........
