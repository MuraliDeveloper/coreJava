	ArithmeticException ex = new ArithmeticException("num2 cannot be 0");
	throw ex;
ArithmeticException is a exception class from java lib..

Can we create our own exception class??
Yes

-> Dev will create Exception class
-> Dev will create exception obj & throw
-> Dev will handle the exception

Why should we create exception class?
ans) To handle the neagtive sceanrios in the project.
ex: 
age < 18 is invalid for the application ,but it is valid for java ...
any invalid data for id , name , usertype  is found we have to create exception.

age < 18 cannot be ArithmeticException.
