Req:
--------
1. Person has
id, name , age , street , city , state , country , pin

2. Student has 
id , fname, lastname , sem , street , city , state , country , pin
create classes


without has-a:
----------------------
- create two classes
 
 class Person:
       id,name,age,streetNo,city,state,country,pin

 class Student:
       id,firstname,lastname,branch,semno,streetNo,city,state,country,pin



Problm:
-----------
1.If we need add new property "landmark" for every address, we need to modify every class
2.Employee class is complex due to many addresses 
the class many instance variables

solution:
-> Create a seperate class for Address
-> Use address obj as the instance variable for all the classes

with has-a:
-------------------------
- create three classes
- Object as a instance variable.

Person class has adress object as instance variable
Student class has adress object as instance variable

class Address{
    String streetNo;
    String city;
    String state;
    String country;
    String pin;
}

class Person{
       int id;
       String name;
       int age;
       Address addrObj;
       # here addrObj is a Address obj
 }
 
class Student{
       int id;
       String firstname;
       String lastname;
       String branch;
       int semno;
       Address addrObj;
       # here addrObj is a Address obj
}

if we create a person obj , then person obj internally contains address obj
if we create a student obj , then student obj internally contains address obj



3.Employee has 
id, fname , lname , pfno , ppfno  +
3 addresses

1.street , city , state , country , pin for permannet address
2.street , city , state , country , pin for present address
3.street , city , state , country , pin for ofice address

without has-a : employee class has 20 instance varibales

with has a 
class Employee{
  int id;
  String fname;
  String lname;
  String pfno;
  String ppfno;
  
  Address presAdd;
  Address permanentAdd;
  Address officeAdd;
}

with has-a Employee class has 8 insance variables

Employee interanlly contains 3 address objs.
