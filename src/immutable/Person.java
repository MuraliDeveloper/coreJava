package immutable;

/**
final class cannot be extended. [ if a class is final, then child class cannot be created ]
final method cannot be overridden[ overriding is not possible ]
final variable cannot be changed. [variable once cretaed , cannot e changed]


Immutable class:
----------------
String objs are immutable .
the obj once created with data cannot be altered.
i.e. once obj is instantiated the state cannot be changed.

mutable obj : state/values can be changed.
immutable obj : state/values cannot be changed.


Steps for creating the immutable class:
---------------------------------------------------------
1. create a public final class
2.make the instance variables as private final.
3.provide only parameterized constructr
4.provide only getters methods ; dont writeany setter methods

ex: 
1.for exception obj
2.read data from source [db/file/external]and we dont want the data to be altered.
