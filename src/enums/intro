  Enum:
  -> Enum is also a class
  -> For enum  we cannot create the object
  -> Enum has predefined objects, 
	-> Enum has limited objs defined in the class
     we need to use the same objects..
  -> Predefined objs also mentioned in the enum class..

  Class - > i.v + i.m + constr +setters +getters + static
  Enum -> i.v. + i.m + contsr  + +setters +getters + + static + predefined objects..
  
  
  For class  we can create any no of objs.
   For enum we need to use only already created objs.
  
  Ex:
  if LoanType is a class
  We have only 6 types of loans Personal, Home, education , Vehical i.e. we should allow to create only 4 objs.
  ex: How do you know what are loantypes supported...???

  ex: LoanType , UserType , CardType , PaymentMode ,

  Enum can be used as constants :
 
  Ex:
  application supports only 5 colors -> use enum
  application supports only 4 LoanTypes -> use enum

  syntax:

  public enum ColorType { // ColorType is a enum 

    BLUE,  // ColorType BLUE = new ColorType();
    RED,  // ColorType RED = new ColorType();
    BLACK,
    GREEN,
    WHITE;

  }


 ColorType x = new ColorType() ; // gives compilation...

Get objs for enum:
--------------------------
ColorType x = ColorType.BLUE; // get already created obj


  print(ColorType.BLUE) ;// get obj
  print(ColorType.RED) ;// get obj

  ->Get the predefined Obj using the enum name;;

  -?How to get all Objs?
  ColorType[] objs = ColorType.values()
