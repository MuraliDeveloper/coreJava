Collections/Data Structures:
--------------------------------
->Isrequired when we have large group of data.
-> collecting and manipulating a group of objects.
->Operations : searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, deletion, updation. 
  
ex: 
Arrays , List (ArrayList + LinkedList + Vector) +Set(HashSet + TreeSet +LinkedHashSet) + Map(HashMap + TreeMap + LinkedHashMap)

java.util -> all the Collection classes.
  

  Arrays:
-------
-> Need to specify the size first 
-> Arrays uses index/position based operations. 
-> insert , update , delete , read based on positions.

  syntax:
int[] numbers = new int[5];  or int numbers[] = new int[5];  // int array with size as 5
String[] numbers = new String[6]; // string array with size of 6
 
 
disadv:
-> Specify size early.
-> Size cannot be increased or decreased 
-> insert in between[multiple right shift operations] or remove in between[multiple ledt shift operations] s costly.
-> search by content is costly
