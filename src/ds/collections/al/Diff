Vector vs ArrayList
---------------------
->Vector is synchronized
-> AL is not syncronized

->Vector is threadsafe
-> AL is not threadsafe

->Vector can be used in multithread environment
-> AL cannot be used in multithread environment



LinkedList vs ArrayList/Vector
---------------------------
->Arraylist/Vector interally uses arrays
->LinkedList internally uses linked DS , every element contain data and ref of next data.
  
->  Search by position is fast for AL/Vector
-> Search by position is slow for Linkedlist


->Insert in between/delete in between is slow for AL/Vector
-> Insert in between/delete in between is fast for Linkedlist


-> Memory allocated and no of elements are not same in AL/Vector.  => Leads to memory wasted.
->Memory allocated and no of elements are same in LinkedList.
  

-> Can grow , but cannot decrease for AL/Vector
-> Can grow and can decrease for LinkedList


common disadv:
-----------------------
-> Duplicates are allowed
-> SEARCH BY CONTENT is very slow
