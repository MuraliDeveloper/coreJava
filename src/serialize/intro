seralization:
-save obj state to the file 
-send over network


deseralization:
- convert file back to obj


steps:
-----------
1.the class has to inmplement the Serializable interface
ex:
Entity class 
Form class
Dto class 

only the obj that hold the data requires the seralization

-Controller, Service , DAO => bean classes doent require the seralization


Serialization:
----------------
-> process for storing obj state in the file system or when we need to send obj over the network..

Serialize:
[ obj data --------> save to file ]


DeSerialize:
[ read from file --------> convert to obj]


Steps:
  1. Class has to implement Serializable interface
  
   
   Serialize:
    1.create file obj
    2.create FileOutputStream obj using file obj
    3.create ObjectOutputStream using FileOutputStream OBJ
    4.use writeObject method and pass the obj to serialize 
    
    
    
  De-Serialize:
    1.create file obj
    2.create FileInputream using  file obj
    3.create ObjectInput using FIS obj
    4.use readObject method to Deserialize 
    
    
  -> transient variable cannot be serialized.
