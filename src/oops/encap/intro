Abstraction:
-> Hide unnecessary data and expose only what ever is required.
->for every action/task there should be only funtion.


Ex:
Class Vechicle:
    wheel,
    engine
    fuel.
    
    void brake(){}
      
    void acclerate{}
      
	void showFuelReading(){}
    
    
Req#1:To stop vehicle 
solution) call the brake()

brake() -> changing the values for the instance variable wheel + engine


Req#2:speedup vehicle
solution) call accelarate() function.

acclearate() - >changing the values for the instance variable wheel + engine using fuel..


Req#3:see the fuel reading:
solution) call the showFuelReading() function..


conclution:
--------------
-> Hide the instance variables and expose the methods.
-> change the instance varibles/read the instance variables using the functions.
-> one action == one function


changes in class:
  1. make instance variables as private
  2.expose the methods to set data and read data (setters & getters)
  for every instance variables provide setter and getter
