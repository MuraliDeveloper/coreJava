Abstraction:
-> Hide unnecessary data and expose only what ever is required.
->for every action/task there should be only funtion.


Ex:
Class Vehicle{
    wheel,
    engine
    fuel.
    
    void brake(){
    //logic to stop car
    }
      
    void acclerate(){
    //logic to speed accelerate
    }
      
	void showFuelReading(){
	//logic to show fuel reading
	}
  }
    
Req#1:To stop vehicle 
solution) call the brake()

brake() -> changing the values for the instance variable wheel + engine


Req#2:speedup vehicle
solution) call accelarate() function.

acclearate() - >changing the values for the instance variable wheel + engine using fuel..


Req#3:see the fuel reading:
solution) call the showFuelReading() function..
shows the current state of the fuel


conclution:
--------------
-> Hide the instance variables and expose the methods.
-> change the instance varibles/read the instance variables using the methods.
[any actn on obj perform using the method]
-> one action == one method


changes in class:
  1. make instance variables as private
  2.expose the methods to set data and read data (setters & getters)
  for every instance variables provide setter and getter 
  
    
  Person p = new Person();
//set data directly
p.id=9000;
p.name="user1";
p.age=45;

//for set data to object use the methods.
