 static block:
------------------
-> static block is executed only 1 time , during class loading
-> static block contains code  only for initializing the static variables.
-> static block is executed before the constructor.
-> write static block inside the class  

syntax:
class Data{

static{
 
  
}

}


instance variables + instance method + constr   ---> 1 set
(specific data)        ( any logic)     ( initializing the i.v. when obj is created)

static variables + static methods + static block ---> 1 set
(common data)      ( logic for s.v.)  ( initializing the s.v. during class loading)
