OOPS:
-------
Object Oriented Programming
->Programming style that defines the common rules , regulations,standards , guidelines for writing better programming

-> Programming style
-> ex: java, .net , python , php , groovy ,go , php , javascript , anagular js

Adv:
--------
Modularity
Easy to read and write
Avoids complexity
code Maintainance
future enhancements.


-> class, object , enapsulation , abstraction , inheritance, polymorphism.

# Class
--------------------------
 -> Userdefined datatype
-> Class is used to represent the real time entities/structure/model.
ex: Company, Branch , Dep, sub-dept, Project , Employee ,
-> Class doesnt contain any data.
-> class is created before run-time
->class is a logical representation
->class is a template


-> Class is  block for instance varibles + functions
    a)insatance variables to hold data for entity
    b)funtion logic would operate on instance varibles


 
syntax for a class:

class Person{
  
	int id;
	String name;
	int age;
// here id,name , age are instance variables.
  
	public void  show(){
		syso("hello inside show")
	}
//show is a instance method.

}
	
.......

Object:
---------
# varible for the class
# instance for the class
# object is created during run time .
# when obj is created memory is allocated for all instance variables.
# object logical + physical representation

#Syntax for obj creation
p1 = Person()

#Class will decide property names for all objs
#Obj will decide property values..

#Set data
p1.id =30000
p1.name ="user1"
p1.age=45

#display data
print(p1.id)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)


# global varibales ------> outside class   --> memory is alocatted 1 time
# local varibales -------> inside function ---> memory is alocated every time

# instance variables -----> inside class    ---> every time when obj is crated , access with obj
# static/class varibles----> inside class ----> memory allocated 1 time  , access with class


1.Requiremnet to capture id,name,age for 10 persons.
solution:
without oops we have to create 30 varibles
without oops we have to create 10 varibles
