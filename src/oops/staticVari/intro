static variables:
  --------------
  global variables.
  memory is created only one time
  static varibales are like the common data for all objs
  
  for instance varables , memoery is created every time when obj is created.
  static variables memeory is created one time during class loading.
  
  
  static variables we need to write inside the class.
  
  class Person{
    int id; // instance variable
    static int count; // static variable
    
  }
  
  static variables ---> common data for all obj
  inst varibales ---> speceific data for every data.
    
  static variables can be accessed without objcet.
  But for accessing the instance variables we need obj.
  
  
  synatx:
    1.access instance varibale
    Person p = new Person
    p.id= 67
    syso(p.id)
    
    
    2.acces sstatic varia
    
  
  
  static methods:
---------------

static methods can be called without object creation.
instance methods should be called only after object creation.

syntax:
  public static void showCount(){
	  // some logic
	}
  
  instance methods -> set/read data for instance variables
  static  methods -> set/read data for static variables
  
  
  
  syntax:
   public class Data{
    public static void showCount(){
	  // some logic
	}
   }
    

    Data.showCount();
    //static methods should be called using clas name.
