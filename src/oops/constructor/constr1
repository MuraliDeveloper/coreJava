Constructor:
-------------------
When obj is created constr is called automatically.
With constr we can set the data during obj creation.
  
  
class Person{
  int id;
  String name;
  ing age;
  
}

Req: create obj + set data



without constr:  [requires 4 lines]
---------------------
Person p = new Person(); //set the data after obj creation
p.id =1000;
p.name="user1";
p.age=45;


with constr:  [requires 1 lines]
---------------------
Person p = new Person(1000,"user1",45); // set the data along with obj creation




ex:
		1.create obj
		2.set data

1. create obj + set data

points:
------------
we need to write constr within the class.
Constr name is equal to class name.
Constr doesnt have any return type.
We can have any number of constr in a single class -> constr overloading..
A constr is called only one time for one obj..




Adv:
  creat obj + set the data in single line.


syntax:
  
class Person  
 {
   int id;
   String name;
   int age;
   
   
   // zero arg constructor
	public Person() {  
		System.out.println("zero arg constructr");
	}

	// param arg bconstructor
	public Person(int id, int age, String pName) {  
		this.id = id;
		this.age = age;
		this.name = pName;
	}
   
  
}
  
  
main(){
  
  
  Person p = new Person();
  Person p1 = new Person(200,"user3",45);  
    
}
  
  
  
 //diff
 1.constr is called one time
 methid can b claled any no of times
 2.constr name = class name
 method  name can be anything
 3.contsr doesnt have any return (even void)
 method have return type ...
 4.cosntr is called during obj creation
 constr is automatic call
 
 method should be called after obj created.
 method is explict call
 
 constr logic -> only initializing i.v
 method logic -> any logic
