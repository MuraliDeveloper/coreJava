Constructor:
-------------------
- constr we need to write inside the classs.
- When obj is created constr is called automatically.
- With constr we can set the data during obj creation.
  
  
   
  
  
class Person{
  int id;
  String name;
  ing age;
  
}

Req: create obj + set data


 


without constr:  [requires 4 lines]
---------------------
Person p = new Person(); //set the data after obj creation
p.id =1000;
p.name="user1";
p.age=45;


with constr:  [requires 1 lines]
---------------------
Person p = new Person(1000,"user1",45); // set the data along with obj creation




points:
------------
Constr name is equal to class name.
Constr doesnt have any return type.
We can have any number of constr in a single class -> constr overloading..
A constr is called only one time for one obj..


Adv:
  creat obj + set the data in single line.




syntax for writing constr:
------------------------------------
  
class Person  
 {
   int id;
   String name;
   int age;
   // id, name, age are instance variables
   
   
   // zero arg constructor
	public Person() {  
		System.out.println("zero arg constructr");
	}

	// param arg bconstructor
	public Person(int id, int age, String pName) {  
		this.id = id;
		this.age = age;
		this.name = pName;
	}
	
	public void show(){ // this is method
	}
   
  
}
  
  
main(){
  
  
  Person p = new Person();
  Person p1 = new Person(200,"user3",45);  
    
}
  
  
  
 //diff
 1.constr is called one time
 method can b called any no of times
 
 2.constr name = class name
 method  name can be anything
 
  3.contsr doesnt have any return type(not even void)
 method have return type(atleast void) ...
 
 4.cosntr is called during obj creation
  method should be called after obj created.
 
 
5.constr is automatic call
method is explict call
 
6. constr logic -> only initializing i.v
 method logic -> any logic
