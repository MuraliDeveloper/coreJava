Exception:
-----------
Unexpected scenario/event that occurs at the run time.


what happens when there is an exception:
--------------------------
-> Prog will stop/ the flow would break.
-> customer will see the technical message instead of meaning ful message.
-> affect the business 




Why do we have Exception?:
----------------
->Bad coding practices
->3rd party/ server/ hardware ex: db down , server is down , file is deleted
-> Missing testing the scenario
-> edge case 





Can we avoid exception during runtime?? NO

exception handling:
---------------------
To handle negative scenarios
Exception handling will be required when there is an exception...
Exception handling is what to do when there is an exception..



Adv:
-> choice for retry/ continue/ stop
->prepare meaning msg to the customer..
-> resume the application flow
->write the technical messages like exception reason+ cause to the server logs


What is java role?
->Java creates the exception object based on the reason
->Exception obj contains the exception msg + what are the class+method+line nos involved for exeption(stacktrace)
->Java stops the application flow..




How to do exception handling:
----------------------------
Introduce three blocks
1. try block
2. catch block
3. finally block

try{
  <write code that has chances for exception>
}
catch(<Exception object>){
  //executed only when there is an exception
  <exception handling code>
}
finally{
  <optionl, required only when dealing with 3rd parties like db, file, web connections...>
  //executed always ...
}
