Exception:
-----------
Unexpected scenario/event that occurs at the run time.

what happens when there is an exception:
--------------------------
-> Prog will stop/ the flow would break.
-> customer will see the techincal message instead of meaning ful message.
-> affect the business 

Why execption?:
----------------
->Bad coding practises
->3rd party/ server/ hardware
-> Missing testing the scenario
-> edge case 


Can we avoid exception during runtime?? NO
exception handling:
---------------------
what to do when there is an exception

What is java role?
->Java created the exception object based on the reason
->Exception obj contains the exception msg + what are the class+method+line nos involved for exeption(stacktrace)
->Java stops the application flow..

Exeception handling will be required when there is an exception...
Exception handling is what to do when there is an exception..


Adv:
-> choice for retry/ continue/ stop
->prepare meaning msg to the customer..
-> resume the application flow
->write the technical messages like execption reason+ cause to the server logs


How to do exception handling:
----------------------------
try{
  <write code that has chances for exception>
}
catch(){
  //executed only when there is an exception
  <exception handling code
}
finally{
  <optionl, required only when dealing with 3rs parties>
  //exceuted always ...
}
