- represent a special type of relationship that is
 it can access all the members (data members and methods) of
  outer class including private.

- used to develop more readable and maintainable code 
because it logically group classes 
and interfaces in one place only.

- It requires less code to write.


 
	Member inner class
	static inner class
	Anonymous inner class
	Local inner class
	
Member inner class:
public class Outer{
 class Inner{
 
 }
}
Outer outerObject = new Outer();
Outer.Inner innerObject = outerObject.new Inner();


Static nested class
--------------------------------

A static class i.e. created inside a class is called static nested class in java. 
It cannot access non-static data members and methods. It can be accessed by outer class name.

It can access static data members of outer class including private.
Static nested class cannot access non-static (instance) data member or method.



public class Outer {
	static class Inner {


		}
}

Outer.Inner nestedObject =
     new Outer.Inner();




Local inner class
----------------------
A class i.e. created inside a method is called local inner class in java. If you want to invoke the methods of local inner class, you must instantiate this class inside the method.
