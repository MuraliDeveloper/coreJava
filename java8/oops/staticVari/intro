static variables:
  --------------
  -> static variable is declared inside the class
  global variables.
  memory is created only one time
  static varibales are like the common data for all objs
  
  for instance varables , memory is created every time when obj is created.
  static variables memeory is created one time during class loading.
  
  
  
      
  
  
  syntax:
  class Person{
    int id; // instance variable
    static int count; // static variable
    
  }
  
  static variables ---> common data for all obj
  inst variables ---> specific data for every data.
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
    
  static variables can be accessed without objcet.
  But for accessing the instance variables we need obj.
  
  class Student{
  
  #instance  variables
  int id;
  String name;
  int semNo;
  
  static String colleageName ; //  static variable memory allocated one time
  
}
  
  -> for accessing static variable object is not required, Class name is sufficient.
  we can call static varibale as "class variables"
  -> for accessing instance variable object is required.
  
  synatx:
  ex1:
    ex:
  #change static varible
  Student.colleageName ="KMR";
  
  
  #access static variable
  System.outr.println(Student.colleageName)   ;
  
 #create obj and set data
    Student s = newe Student();
    s.id=2000;
	s.name="kumar";
	s.semNo=3;
		
  ex2:
    
    Person p = new Person
    p.id= 67
    syso(p.id)
    
    
    2.acces sstatic varia
    Person.count =
  
  
  static methods:
---------------

static methods can be called without object creation.
instance methods should be called only after object creation.
static methods can access only static variables,
static methods cannot access instance variables.

to operate on instance variable we need instance methods.
to operate on static variables we need static methods.




















syntax:
  public static void showCount(){
	  // some logic
	}
  
  instance methods -> set/read data for instance variables
  static  methods -> set/read data for static variables
  
  
  syntax:
   public class Data{
    public static void showCount(){
	  // some logic
	}
   }
    

    Data.showCount();
    //static methods should be called using clas name.
