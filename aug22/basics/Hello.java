//The .java file should contain one class file
// the class name should be equal to the file name.


//main + control + space ===> generate the main method

// if the class contains main method then only it is eligible for running/execution.
//output can be seen in the console window.

//System.out.println() -> funtion for printing the content to the console window.

// write code/logic inside the main method.
//outside thge main method we should not write any logic
