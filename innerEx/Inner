- represent a special type of relationship that is
 it can access all the members (data members and methods) of
  outer class including private.

- used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.

- It requires less code to write.


Non-static nested class (inner class)
	Member inner class
	Anonymous inner class
	Local inner class

OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass();
OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();


Static nested class
--------------------------------

A static class i.e. created inside a class is called static nested class in java. 
It cannot access non-static data members and methods. It can be accessed by outer class name.

It can access static data members of outer class including private.
Static nested class cannot access non-static (instance) data member or method.

OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject =
     new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();





Local inner class
----------------------
A class i.e. created inside a method is called local inner class in java. If you want to invoke the methods of local inner class, you must instantiate this class inside the method.
